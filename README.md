Project Title: Parallel Word Frequency Analyzer with GPU Acceleration via Mobile-Server Architecture  Project Description: This project is a comprehensive word frequency analysis system that leverages parallel and distributed computing principles to handle large-scale text processing efficiently. The system consists of a mobile application (developed using Expo and React Native) and a server-side backend (implemented in FastAPI with GPU acceleration via CuPy).  The mobile app allows users to upload multiple text-based documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT) from their device. After a diagnostic check to ensure server connectivity (visualized with a Matrix-style interface), files are uploaded to the backend server, where advanced preprocessing and word frequency analysis are performed using GPU-parallelized code.  The analyzed results are then displayed on the mobile app through an interactive and professional UI. Key features include:  Top Words Bar Charts for each file.  General Summary view showing aggregated results across files.  Detailed File View with a scrollable table of all word counts.  Sortable Tables by word or frequency.  Dark/Light Theme Toggle.  Smooth UI Transitions.  This project demonstrates real-world application of parallelism, GPU computing, API communication, multi-file handling, and cross-platform UI design, making it a powerful educational and practical showcase of modern distributed systems.
